\usage{
get_fangraphs_fans(year, limit_unmatched = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{year}{desired year.  valid values: 2016}

\item{limit_unmatched}{if TRUE (the default behavior) will only
return players with an mlbid that can be matched.  look at `id_map`
and the `universal_metadata` vignette for more about the id map
we're using to match players to ids.
fundamentally, you need a consistent, unique identifier if you
want to work with multiple projection systems.  so this really
needs to be TRUE.}
