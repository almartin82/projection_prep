# projprep
**projprep** is an R package that helps read, clean up, and convert baseball projection data into prices.

## installation
projprep is written in R.
If you're new to R, start by installing:

* [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
* [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/#Desktop)

`projprep` is _not_ yet available on [cran](https://cran.r-project.org/), the home of R packages.  That means you'll need to install it with `devtools`:

```
install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)

devtools::install_github('almartin82/projprep')
library(projprep)
```

Here's how to read in, clean, and convert the fantasypros projections:

```
raw_fp <- get_fantasy_pros(2016)
fp_pp <- proj_prep(raw_fp)
head(fp_pp) %>% as.data.frame()
```
